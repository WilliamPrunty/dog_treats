# Analysis of Biscuit Type Dog Treats

## Overview
Utilizing information scraped from a popular pet supplies retailer this project aims to explore what relationships exist between price, rating, and number of ingredients listed. 


## Motivation
Having a pet with allergies and dietary limitations has led my partner to prepare dog treats at home. As she has gained experience catering to the needs of our pet, others have expressed interest in her product and process. I would like to gain some insight into what the current market looks like. Additionally, understanding of current treat prices at a retail scale may provide some guidelines on competitive pricing should she decide to market her treats.


## Data Question
1.  Is there a relationship between reviews and prices?

2.  Is there a relationship between 'limited ingredient' treats and price?
